<b><h2>Problem Statement :- </h2></b>

Automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others.

<b><h2>Skills :- </h2></b>
<ul><li>Python</li>
<li>Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn</li>
<li>Model : KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, RandomForestClassifier</li>
<li> Best Model Selection : LogisticRegression</li>
 <b>[ Logistic regression can be used for our model as its giving effective training testing accuracy ]</b></ul>
